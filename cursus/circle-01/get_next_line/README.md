# Get Next Line

> Reading a line from a fd is way too tedious

## Summary

This project is about programming a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor

## Goals

This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection,
but it will also make you learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming: **static variables**.

## Mandatory Part

| Key                | Value                                                                                           |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Function name      | `get_next_line`                                                                                 |
| Prototype          | `char *get_next_line(int fd);`                                                                  |
| Turn in files      | `get_next_line.c`, `get_next_line_utils.c`, `get_next_line.h`                                   |
| Parameters         | `fd`: The file descriptor to read from                                                          |
| Return value       | **Read line**: correct behavior<br/>`NULL`: there is nothing else to read, or an error occurred |
| External functions | `read`, `malloc`, `free`                                                                        |
| Description        | Write a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor                                |

- Repeated calls (e.g., using a loop) to your `get_next_line()` function should let you read the text file pointed to by the file descriptor, one line at a time.
- Your function should return the line that was read. If there is nothing else to read or if an error occurred, it should return `NULL`.
- Make sure that your function works as expected both when reading a **file** and when reading from the **standard input**.
- Please note that the returned line should include the terminating `\n` character, except if the **end of file** was reached and does not end with a `\n` character.
- Your header file `get_next_line.h` must at least contain the prototype of the `get_next_line()` function.
- Add all the helper functions you need in the `get_next_line_utils.c` file.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è A good start would be to know what a `static variable` is.

- Because you will have to read files in `get_next_line()`, add this option to your compiler call:
	```
	-D BUFFER_SIZE=n
	```
	It will define the buffer size for `read()`.
	The buffer size value will be modified by your peer-evaluators and the Moulinette in order to test your code.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è We must be able to compile this project with and without the `-D BUFFER_SIZE` flag in addition to the usual flags
> You can choose the default value of your choice.

- You will compile your code as follows (a buffer size of `42` is used as an example):
	```shell
	cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 <files>.c
	```
- We consider that `get_next_line()` has an undefined behavior if the file pointed to by the file descriptor changed since the last call whereas `read()` didn't reach the end of file.
- We also consider that `get_next_line()` has an undefined behavior when reading a binary file. However, you can implement a logical way to handle this behavior if you want to.

> üí° Does your function still work if the `BUFFER_SIZE` value is `9999`? If it is `1`? `10000000`? Do you know why?

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Try to read as little as possible each time `get_next_line()` is called. If you encounter a new line, you have to return the current line.<br/>
> Don't read the whole file and then process each line.

### Forbidden
- You are not allowed to use your `libft` in this project.
- `lseek()` is forbidden.
- Global variables are forbidden.

## Bonus Part

This project is straightforward and doesn't allow complex bonuses. However, we trust your creativity. If you completed the mandatory part, give a try to this bonus part.

Here are the bonus part requirements:

- [] Develop `get_next_line()` using **only one static variable**.
- [] Your `get_next_line()` can **manage multiple file descriptors at the same time**.
	For example, if you can read from the file descriptors 3, 4 and 5, you should be able to read from a different `fd` per call without losing the reading thread of each file descriptor or returning a line from another `fd`.<br/>
	It means that you should be able to call `get_next_line()` to read from `fd` 3, then fd 4, then 5, then once again 3, once again 4, and so forth.

Append the `_bonus.[c\h]` suffix to the bonus part files.<br/>
It means that, in addition to the mandatory part files, you will turn in the 3 following files:

- `get_next_line_bonus.c`
- `get_next_line_bonus.h`
- `get_next_line_utils_bonus.c`

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è When writing your tests, remember that:
> 1. Both the buffer size and the line size can be of very different values.
> 1. A file descriptor does not only point to regular files.<br/>
> Be smart and cross-check with your peers. Prepare a full set of diverse tests for defense.

Once passed, do not hesitate to add your `get_next_line()` to your `libft`.
